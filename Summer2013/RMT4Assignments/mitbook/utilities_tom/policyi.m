function [f,p] = policyi(A,B,R,Q,S)
%function [f,p] = policyi(A,B,R,Q,S)
%  Policy iteration algorithm of Howard applied to linear regulator
%  Also known as Newton's method
%
%     POLICYI calculates f of the feedback law:
%
%		u = -fx
%
%  that maximizes the function:
%
%          sum [x'Rx + u'Qu +2u'Sx]
%
%  subject to
%		x[t+1] = Ax[t] + Bu[t]
%
%  where x is the nx1 vector of states, u is the kx1 vector of controls,
%  A is nxn, B is nxk, R is nxn, Q is kxk, S is k \times n.
%
%  The optimal policy is u = -f x.
%  The program also returns p, the steady-state solution to the associated
%  discrete matrix Riccati equation; the optimal value function is x'px.
